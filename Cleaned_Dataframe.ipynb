Consider customers with a high policy claim amount to be those in the top 25% of the total claim amount, and clients with a low customer lifetime value to be those in the bottom 25% of the customer lifetime value. Create a pandas DataFrame object that contains information about customers with a policy claim amount greater than the 75th percentile and a customer lifetime value in the bottom 25th percentile.\n",
    "- Use DataFrame methods to calculate summary statistics about the high policy claim amount and low customer lifetime value data. To do so, select both columns of the dataframe simultaneously and pass it to the `.describe()` method. This will give you descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for both columns at the same time, allowing you to compare and analyze their characteristics."
